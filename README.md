By Rustam-Z üöÄ

Can be used by Backend Developers, Data engineers, Test Automation engineers, and anyone who wants to advance in Python.

## Senior Python Developer Skill Set

- Advanced Python.Core and Python.OOP: object model, decorators, iterators, generators, context managers, OOP tricks.
- Python clean coding, and engineering excellence
- Development principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS...) and design patterns
- Parallel programming, concurrency, async
- [Fancy data types](data_structures): `dataclasses`, `collections`, `typing`
- Must know libraries: `logging`, `argparse`, `pathlib`, `os`, `sys`, `requests`, `itertools`, `json`, `yaml`, `csv`
- Testing: API and E2E testing with PyTest, unittest, and Selenium
